
#  To demonstrate how the data objects are moving across different packages, I denote an object name with:
#  name.pbs for PBSmapping object (polySet)
#  name.sp  for sp object (there are many types - spatialPolygons, spatialLines, spatialPolygonDataFrame, spatialLineDataFrame, etc)
#  name.gg  for ggplot (which is actually just a normal old data.frame)

#  Normally, I would overwrite the intermediate objects as I go, but I'm keeping the files from each data type for comparison as we go.
